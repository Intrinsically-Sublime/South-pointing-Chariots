---Description---

The south pointing chariot is an ancient mechanical compass invented in China around 200 C.E. Texts mention their use up until around 1300 C.E. and they have descriptions of how they were built. But unfortunately there are no examples of ancient ones still in existence. Thankfully many people over the years have interpreted the ancient texts to come up with a variety of designs. Most of these designs use counter rotating differentials connected to each wheel and a common differential in the center with a pointing device to indicate South. How the differentials are oriented and connected to each other varies greatly though. I found this to be one of the most elegant designs and its attributed to a Mr. Nuttall.

This makes a great Demo showing the capabilities of 3D printing and will impress everyone you show. It only has ONE stationary part and 11-14 moving parts depending on configuration.

Version Information
Spiral gear version is made for printing on a well tuned machine.
It uses GeneralRulOfDumbs' spiral gears at 66% of the original size.
I printed it at 0.14mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle at 20mm/s perimeter, 30mm/s infill.

Version Information
Spur gear version is made for printing on the average machine.
It uses 15 tooth spur gears generated by Blender
I printed it at 0.28mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle at 20mm/s perimeter, 50mm/s infill.

File organization
All the gears have a small support structure that needs to be removed with a pair of needle nose pliers or screwdriver.

100x100_plate 1&2 are made to fit on 100mm x 100mm build surface.
Plate 1 contains all the parts except the wheels. (one spider gear per side)
Plate 2 contains one wheel. (it needs to be printed twice)

200x200_plate is made to fit on a 200mm x 200mm build surface.
It contains all the parts plus the third and fourth spider gears that are not really required but look cool, plus the tux penguin pictured.

Zip file contains all the parts individually.

The Blend file is very large and processor heavy but 99% parametric (minus the gears).
The spur gear version requires the spiral gear version Blend file for linked parts.

Tools
Needle nose pliers or flat head screw driver. (to remove support)
M6 die (or 1/4" die)
Hex keys (allen keys)
Wrench for M6 nut (or 1/4" nut)
Drill with 4mm and 6mm drill bits (or 11/64" and 1/4")
CA glue (instant glue)

BOM
115mm of 6mm smooth rod (brass is preferred) (I used 1/4" and drilled the holes)
2 * M6 nuts (or 1/4" if using 1/4" smooth rod)
3-5 * M4 x 12 cap screws (I used no8 x 1/2" and drilled the holes)
2 * 5/16 nuts (sorry M8 will not work) threads pitch does not matter
3-10 * M4 or M5 washers. (no8 or no10)
3-5 * M4 nuts (or no8)
2 * 3-15/16" x 3-3/4" x3/32" O-ring (3.9375 x 3.75 x 0.094) (100mm x 95.25mm x 2.4mm)Options / Alternatives

no8 x 1/2" cap screws can be used in place of the M4 x 12 cap screws with a little drilling. (no8 is 0.14mm larger than in diameter than a M4 bolt)

1/4" smooth rod can be used in place of the 6mm smooth rod with a little drilling. (1/4" is 0.3mm larger in diameter than the 6mm smooth rod)

Push on clips can be used in place of the retaining nut on the smooth rod. This eliminates the need for an M6 die (1/4" die). May even be printable.

You can use any mascot you wish. It does require a small recess in the bottom to allow it to sit over the center gears bolt and nut. The recess can easily be added with a drill if you already have something printed.

Only two spider gears are included in the 100x100 plates. If you would like the third and fourth they can be printed from the individual files.

No mascot included in the 100x100 plates. Available in the individual files.
